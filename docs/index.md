# SCE-88 Documentation

Welcome to the State-Coherent Enforcement Architecture (SCE-88) documentation.

## Overview

SCE-88 is a deterministic coherence enforcement substrate designed for distributed systems. It provides a rigorous framework for maintaining state consistency across system boundaries through layered enforcement mechanisms.

## Quick Start

For installation and setup instructions, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/wizardaax/SCE-88/blob/main/README.md).

## Architecture

The architecture is organized into several key areas:

- **[Architecture](spec/architecture.md)**: Core architectural principles and design
- **[Enforcement Levels](spec/levels.md)**: Hierarchical enforcement levels (L0-L4)
- **[System Domains](spec/domains.md)**: Domain-specific coherence rules
- **[Security](spec/security.md)**: Security framework and mechanisms
- **[Compliance](spec/compliance.md)**: Compliance standards and requirements
