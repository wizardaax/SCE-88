# SCE-88 Documentation

This documentation renders the canonical specification.
No new meaning may be introduced here.

Scope:
- Authoritative specification with executable validation logic to verify structure, ordering, and isolation
- Capabilities remain inherent to SCE-88 and manifest when the architecture is instantiated and validated
