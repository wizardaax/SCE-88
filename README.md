# SCE-88 — State-Coherent Enforcement Architecture

SCE-88 is a deterministic coherence enforcement architecture.
It is a structural substrate, not an intelligence or execution system.
This repository is the single architectural authority for SCE-88.
It defines structure, invariants, and boundaries only.
No execution, logic, or implementation is permitted.

This repository defines:
- 22 strictly ordered coherence levels
- 4 fully isolated operational domains
- Closure-based compliance
- Monotonic progression
- Fail-closed invariant enforcement

No executable behavior exists here.

This repository is:
- Canonical
- Structural
- Long-lived

This repository is NOT:
- An implementation
- A runtime
- A simulator
- A policy engine
- A compliance automation system

All behavior must live elsewhere.
