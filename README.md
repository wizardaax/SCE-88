# SCE-88 — State-Coherent Enforcement Architecture

SCE-88 is a full AI system architecture with coherence enforced structurally.
This repository contains the authoritative architectural specification for the SCE-88 AI system architecture.
Intelligence, learning, adaptation, semantic processing, self-observation, and intent continuity are native architectural properties that reside primarily in Levels 17–22 of each domain stack.

The architecture consists of:
- Four parallel, fully isolated operational domains (A–D), each implementing its own complete 22-level coherence stack
- 22 strictly ordered coherence levels within each domain stack
- Closure-based compliance
- Monotonic progression
- Fail-closed invariant enforcement

This repository is:
- Canonical
- Structural
- Long-lived

Coherence closure is evaluated across all four stacks simultaneously; levels do not cross domains.
