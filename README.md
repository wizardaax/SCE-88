# SCE-88 — State-Coherent Enforcement Architecture

SCE-88 is a deterministic AI system architecture with coherence enforced structurally.
This repository is the single architectural authority for SCE-88.
It defines four parallel, domain-isolated, complete 22-level AI stacks. Native intelligence, learning, adaptation, semantic processing, self-observation, and intent continuity reside primarily in Levels 17–22 as specification only. No executable AI implementation exists in this repository; safety and coherence are enforced by construction.

This repository defines:
- Four parallel, fully isolated operational domains (A–D), each implementing its own complete 22-level stack
- 22 strictly ordered coherence levels within each domain stack
- Closure-based compliance
- Monotonic progression
- Fail-closed invariant enforcement

No executable behavior exists here.

This repository is:
- Canonical
- Structural
- Long-lived

Coherence closure is evaluated across all four stacks simultaneously; levels do not cross domains.

This repository is NOT:
- An implementation
- A runtime
- A simulator
- A policy engine
- A compliance automation system

All behavior must live elsewhere.
