# SCE-88 — State-Coherent Enforcement Architecture

SCE-88 is a full AI system architecture with coherence enforced structurally.
This repository contains the canonical architectural specification for SCE-88; executable implementations are out of scope.
The architecture comprises four parallel, domain-isolated, complete 22-level AI stacks.
Native intelligence, learning, adaptation, semantic processing, self-observation, and intent continuity reside in Levels 17–22 of each domain stack.

This repository defines:
- Four parallel, fully isolated operational domains (A–D), each implementing its own complete 22-level stack
- 22 strictly ordered coherence levels within each domain stack
- Closure-based compliance
- Monotonic progression
- Fail-closed invariant enforcement

This repository is:
- Canonical
- Structural
- Long-lived

Coherence closure is evaluated across all four stacks simultaneously; levels do not cross domains; this is not a single 22-level stack spanning domains.
