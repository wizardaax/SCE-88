# SCE-88

**State-Coherent Enforcement Architecture (SCE-88)**

A deterministic coherence enforcement substrate for distributed systems.

## Overview

SCE-88 is a framework designed to provide deterministic state coherence enforcement across distributed components. It establishes a rigorous architecture for maintaining consistency guarantees in complex systems through layered enforcement mechanisms.

### Key Features

- **Deterministic Enforcement**: Predictable coherence behavior across system boundaries
- **Layered Architecture**: Hierarchical enforcement levels for flexible deployment
- **Domain-Specific Controls**: Customizable coherence rules per system domain
- **Security-First Design**: Built-in security and compliance mechanisms

## Scope

The SCE-88 architecture covers:

- State coherence protocols and enforcement mechanisms
- Multi-level enforcement hierarchy (L0-L4)
- Domain-specific coherence rules and policies
- Security and compliance frameworks
- Integration patterns for distributed systems

## Status

**Current Version**: 0.1.0 (Alpha)

This project is in early development. The core architecture and specifications are being defined.
