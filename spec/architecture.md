# SCE-88 Architectural Definition

SCE-88 defines a fixed, layered, domain-isolated state-space architecture.

Properties:
- Fixed depth (22 levels)
- Fixed domain count (4)
- No vertical extension
- No cross-domain state sharing
- Closure required across all domains

Coherence is enforced by structure alone.
