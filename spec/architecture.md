# SCE-88 Architectural Definition

SCE-88 defines a fixed, layered, domain-isolated AI system architecture at specification level.

Properties:
- Fixed depth (22 levels)
- Fixed domain count (4)
- No vertical extension
- No cross-domain state sharing
- Closure required across all domains

Coherence, safety, and intelligence expression are enforced by structure alone; intelligence, learning, adaptation, semantic processing, self-observation, and intent continuity are bounded within Levels 17–22.
