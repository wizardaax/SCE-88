# SCE-88 Operational Domains

SCE-88 operates across four isolated domains.
Each domain implements all 22 levels independently.

Domain A — Physical / Substrate  
Domain B — Control / Computational  
Domain C — Semantic / Interface  
Domain D — Temporal / Evolutionary  

Domains do not share internal state.
All cross-domain interaction is explicitly gated.
