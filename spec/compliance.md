# SCE-88 Compliance Definition

A system is SCE-88 compliant if and only if it:
- Implements all 22 levels per domain
- Enforces strict domain isolation
- Uses explicit gating
- Enforces monotonic progression
- Fails closed on invariant violation
- Demonstrates closure at Level 19 across all domains
- Preserves intent continuity

Partial compliance is invalid.
