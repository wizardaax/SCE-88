# Compliance Definition

A system is SCE-88 compliant if and only if it:

- Implements all 22 coherence levels per domain
- Enforces strict domain isolation
- Uses explicit, verifiable gating for cross-domain interaction
- Enforces monotonic progression
- Fails closed on invariant violation
- Demonstrates closure at Level 19 across all domains
- Preserves intent continuity across time and change

Partial compliance is not valid.

This specification defines the complete architectural boundary.
